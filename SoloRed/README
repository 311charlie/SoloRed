New Assignment 2 Changes:
- Changed Canvas Card implementation to be constructed through the PlayingCard given only a color,
  all canvas cards have a number value of -1 to indicate that the number is unusable.

- Changed Model view implementation to only output the first character of the canvas card toString,
  which completely removes any number associated to the canvas card in the string output and only
  outputs its abbreviated color.

- Moved Color Rules to their own package implementing their own interface

- Documented meaning of fields based on self-eval

- Separated whether palette is winning from play methods based on self-eval

- Improved javadoc clarifying what happens when the given deck to startGame is null

- Added a test for deck shuffling

New Assignment 4 Changes:
- Refactored color rules to be constructed without fields

- Created NewLine transmit helper class according to self-eval

- Added newline to end of render method according to self-eval

- Added tests according to self-eval

- Created an abstract RedGameModel class. This is so that the actual RedGameModel game types
  are to be instantiated as their own game types rather than having one game type of RedGameModel
  extend a different game type of RedGameModel. Fields in the abstract class are all protected
  for future models to use without reimplementation of fields.

- Changed various Color Rule implementations for edge cases not included in documentation and
  proper tieRule handling
